# HW3-Std-Dev

## Problem

#### Create three lists:

<ul>
    <li>Cost - $10, $12, $14, $15, $16, $16, $17, $18.5, $19, 19.5</li>
    <li> Time in minutes – 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 11, 11.5, 12, 13</li>
    <li> Number of units fixed – 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28</li>
</ul>
	
<p>The above lists describe the repair cost, repair time and repair units for a shop fixing computer hardware.  This is a typical big data problem where the analyst will be asked to predict the cost for a customer with a computer with faulty 20 parts which will take 6 minutes to fix.  We will calculate following statistics data to help the analyst.:</p>

#### Please calculate:

<ul>
    <li>Sum, Mean, Mode, Median, Min, and Max for each of the above three variables of Cost, Time and Units </li>
    <li> Standard Error of each of these variables from Mean and list the results in two buckets.one bucket where the values are less than the mean and other buckets where the values are higher than the mean. </li>
    
</ul>

#### Please print the results in following format:

<ul>
    <li>Mean of Cost = $xx</li>
    <li> Mean of Time = xxx mins </li>
    <li> Mean of Units = xxx</li>
    <li>Standard Error of Cost variables from Mean:
        <ul>
            <li>Values higher than Mean: x, y, z etc</li>
            <li>Values less than Mean: p, q, r etc</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Standard Error of Time variables from Mean:
        <ul>
            <li>Values higher than Mean: x, y, z etc</li>
            <li>Values less than Mean: p, q, r etc</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Standard Error of Units variables from Mean:
        <ul>
            <li>Values higher than Mean: x, y, z etc</li>
            <li>Values less than Mean: p, q, r etc</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    
</ul>
